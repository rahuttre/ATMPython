# Prompt: Your task for this project is to create a simple ATM script.
# The script emphasizes the importance of using functions in the creation
# of more organized, reusable code.  Your script must include the following:

    # 1) Collect Customer input
    # 2) Calculate the ending balance
    # 3) Display the results to the customer

import sys

account_balance = float(500.25)

# The function printbalance() simply outputs the current balance to the 
# customer.  This does not need to take in any parameters because it just 
# prints the balance.
def printbalance():
  print("Your current balance:\n" , account_balance)

# deposit() deposits additional funds into the user's account with the amount
# specified by the user (request_amount). request_amount is converted to a
# float to add it to the parameter current_balance. Lastly, the function prints the 
# request_amount and the current account_balance. 
def deposit(current_balance):
  request_amount = float(input("How much would you like to deposit today?\n"))
  current_balance += request_amount
  print("Deposit was $%.2f" % request_amount, ", current balance is $%.2f" % current_balance) 

# withdrawal() deducts a funds into the user's account with the amount
# specified by the user (withdrawal_amount). withdrawal_amount is converted to a
# float to subtract it from the current_balance parameter. An if statement is used
# to ensure the withdrawal_amount does not exceed the accunt_balance; if it does, 
# the function outputs to the screen, otherwise, it withdrawals the amount. Lastly, 
# the function prints the request_amount and the current account_balance. 
def withdrawal(current_balance):
  withdrawal_amount = float(input("How much would you like to withdraw today?\n"))
  if (withdrawal_amount > account_balance):
    print("$%.2f" % withdrawal_amount, "is greater than your account balance of $%.2f" % account_balance)
  else:
    current_balance -= withdrawal_amount
    print("Withdrawal amount was $%.2f" % withdrawal_amount, ", current balance is $%.2f" % current_balance)
  
userchoice = input ("What would you like to do?\n")

# The conditionals below outline the main portion of the script excecution.  The functions
# described above are called here depending on the user input.  The global variable account_balance
# is passed to the deposit() and withdrawal() functions as parameters.  If the user selects 'Q'
# or any letter other than 'D', 'B', or 'W', the program quits.
if(userchoice == 'D'):
  deposit(account_balance)
elif(userchoice == 'W'):
  withdrawal(account_balance)
elif(userchoice == 'B'):
  printbalance()
else:
  print("Thank you for banking with us.")
